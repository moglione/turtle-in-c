# turtle-in-c
tortuga.h is a "header only" library that adds turtle graphics functions (LOGO type) to the C and C++ languages. It was developed to teach programming to teenagers transitioning from visual programming languages ​​(Scratch, mBlock) to text-based languages.

###For example: the following program will draw a square 1000 steps in size per side on the screen

###Functions can also be written in abbreviated form, for example **forward()** can be written as **fw()**. and **rightTurn()** in this other way **rt()**.
